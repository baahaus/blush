# Blush -- Team CLI Agent

> ap.haus -- AI Research & Applied Intelligence

## Philosophy

Three pillars, stolen from the best and combined into something new:

1. **Pi's minimalism** -- 4 core tools, sub-1000-token system prompt, primitives over features
2. **Claude Code's best ideas** -- /btw, agent teams, /compact, /branch, conversation forking
3. **Team-native from day 1** -- multi-agent coordination is core architecture, not an extension

Blush is a terminal coding agent where agents are peers. Not parent-child. Not orchestrator-worker. Peers that coordinate through mailboxes, share context through worktrees, and reach consensus through structured synthesis.

Blush is the CLI. `ap.haus` is the research org. The tool embodies the research.

## April 2026 Reality Check

Blush has the right package shape and a credible core loop, but it does not yet feel as polished or trustworthy as Claude Code, Codex, or Amp.

Current product gaps:
- Session continuity needs to feel first-class: deterministic resume, richer metadata, visible history, branch navigation
- Trust surfaces need work: cost reporting must be accurate or omitted, model/provider behavior needs clearer framing
- Input still feels like a basic REPL instead of a terminal-native composer
- Tool execution needs a better timeline with calmer defaults and better expansion for detail
- Team workflows exist, but the implementation is thinner than the product story implies

### Near-Term Product Roadmap

**P0 -- Trust + Continuity**
- Deterministic resume with metadata-rich session list and picker
- Stronger session previews, titles, timestamps, and active-branch visibility
- Replace placeholder token-cost math with provider-aware pricing or remove cost until correct
- Make errors, retries, and rate limits read like product surfaces instead of raw failures

**P1 -- Terminal UX**
- Replace bare readline input with a retained composer
- Add multiline drafting, slash-command completion, shell/path completion, and input history
- Support queueing follow-ups, interrupting after tool completion, and cleaner abort behavior
- Improve transcript hierarchy so user, assistant, tools, and status each have distinct visual roles

**P2 -- Advanced Flows**
- Real branch picker and history navigation instead of exposing raw branch ids
- Session browser with timestamps, summaries, cwd labels, and quick previews
- Tool timeline with collapsible detail for long-running commands and verbose output
- Overlay and side-panel style affordances for `/btw`, `/diff`, and `/context`

**P3 -- Team-Native Execution**
- Mailbox polling integrated into the live agent loop
- Task queue surfaced in CLI with ownership and progress
- Better synthesis/review/pipeline UX and clearer merge/cleanup lifecycle
- Tighten docs and in-product copy so claims match reality

## Package Details

### @blush/ai -- LLM Layer

Unified interface across providers. Streaming-first. Tool calling via TypeBox schemas.

**Providers (phase 1):**
- Anthropic (Claude) -- primary
- OpenAI (GPT/o-series)
- Google (Gemini)
- Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, vLLM, etc.)

**Key features:**
- `stream()` -- streaming responses with tool calls
- `complete()` -- single-shot completion
- Token counting + cost tracking per call and per session
- Mid-session model switching with automatic context handoff
- Thinking/reasoning trace normalization across providers
- Provider-specific auth (API keys, OAuth, subscription)

**Design decisions:**
- No retry logic in the LLM layer. Callers handle retries.
- Token counting is provider-reported, not estimated.
- Tool schemas use TypeBox for runtime validation + static typing.
- Context handoff converts provider-specific formats (Anthropic thinking blocks become `<thinking>` tags for others).

### @blush/core -- Agent Loop

The brain. Runs the tool-calling loop, manages state, handles message flow.

**Core Tools:**
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `read` | Read files (text + images), 2000-line default, offset/limit support |
| `write` | Create or overwrite files |
| `edit` | Exact string replacement with uniqueness validation |
| `bash` | Shell execution, timeout support, background mode |
| `glob` | File finding by pattern |
| `grep` | Regex-backed content search |
| `todo` | Structured task tracking for the current session |
| `web_fetch` | Fetch a web page and extract readable text |
| `web_search` | Search the web for current information |

**Agent loop:**
```
User message → System prompt assembly → LLM call → Tool execution → Loop until done
```

**State management:**
- JSONL session files with tree structure (id + parentId per entry)
- Branching within a single file -- navigate to any point and fork
- Compaction preserves full history, summarizes for context
- Sessions stored at `~/.blush/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/`

**Context assembly (priority order):**
1. System prompt (base, cached)
2. `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` (global ~/.blush/ + per-directory, hierarchical)
3. `SYSTEM.md` override (full replacement)
4. `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` (append-only)
5. System reminders (injected mid-conversation, preserves cache)
6. Skills (loaded on-demand)

**Message queue target:**
- Enter = steering message (interrupts after current tool call)
- Alt+Enter = follow-up (queued until full completion)
- Escape = abort with recovery
- Double-Escape = rewind to checkpoint

### @blush/tui -- Terminal UI

Retained-mode terminal rendering. Not React-based. Direct ANSI escape codes with differential updates.

**Components:**
- Streaming markdown renderer with syntax highlighting
- Input line with file/path completion
- Overlay system (for /btw responses)
- Status bar (model, tokens, cost, context %)
- Progress indicators
- Diff viewer (for /diff)
- Context grid (for /context)

**Rendering:**
- Synchronized output (no tearing)
- Differential updates (only redraw what changed)
- 256-color + truecolor support
- Responsive to terminal resize

### @blush/cli -- Main Binary

The `blush` command. Sessions, commands, modes.

**Commands (cherry-picked from Claude Code + pi):**

| Command | Source | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `/btw <question>` | CC | Ephemeral question -- full context, no tools, no history. Rendered in dismissible overlay. |
| `/compact [focus]` | CC | Compress conversation with optional focus instructions |
| `/branch` | CC | Fork conversation at current point |
| `/context` | CC | Visualize context usage as colored grid |
| `/diff` | CC | Show uncommitted changes + per-turn diffs |
| `/team` | NEW | Team management: spawn, message, status, synthesize |
| `/model [name]` | Pi | Switch model mid-session |
| `/effort [level]` | CC | Set model effort (low/medium/high/max) |
| `/color [color]` | CC | Set prompt color per session |
| `/copy [N]` | CC | Copy Nth response, interactive block picker |

**Operating modes:**
1. **Interactive** -- full TUI with streaming
2. **Print** -- scripting output for pipelines (`blush -p "question"`)
3. **JSON** -- structured output (`blush --json "question"`)
4. **RPC** -- JSONL over stdin/stdout for embedding
5. **SDK** -- programmatic via `createSession()`

**Session management:**
- `blush -r` resumes the most recent saved session
- `blush --new` starts a fresh session
- `blush --session <id>` resumes a specific session
- `blush sessions` lists sessions for the current directory
- `/resume` switches sessions in-process

### @blush/team -- Multi-Agent Coordination

The differentiator. Agents are peers, not subagents.

**Architecture:**
```
┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐
│ Agent A  │────▶│ Mailbox │◀────│ Agent B  │
│ (worktree│     │ System  │     │ (worktree│
│  alpha)  │     │         │     │  beta)   │
└─────────┘     └─────────┘     └─────────┘
      │              │                │
      ▼              ▼                ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            Task Queue (shared)            │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Isolation:**
- Each agent gets its own git worktree
- No shared filesystem state (agents can't step on each other)
- Communication only through mailboxes
- Worktree cleanup when agent completes (auto-merge if clean)

**Mailbox system:**
- File-based message passing (`~/.blush/team/<session>/mailbox/<agent-id>/`)
- Structured messages: `{ from, to, type, payload, timestamp }`
- Types: `request`, `response`, `broadcast`, `status`, `artifact`
- Agents poll their mailbox between tool calls

**Task queue:**
- Shared task board per team session
- States: `pending` -> `claimed` -> `in_progress` -> `done` / `blocked`
- Any agent can create, claim, or complete tasks
- Dependencies tracked (task A blocks task B)

**Consensus patterns:**
- **Synthesis** -- one agent collects outputs from others, produces unified result
- **Vote** -- agents independently assess, majority wins
- **Review** -- one agent's output is reviewed by another before merging
- **Pipeline** -- sequential handoff (agent A -> agent B -> agent C)

**Team commands:**
```
/team spawn <name> [--prompt "..."]   # Create new peer agent
/team msg <name> <message>            # Send message to agent
/team status                          # Show all agents + tasks
/team synthesize                      # Collect all outputs, produce unified result
/team merge <name>                    # Merge agent's worktree back
```

## Features Stolen from Claude Code

These are the non-obvious, high-leverage features worth taking:

### /btw -- Ephemeral Questions
The inverse of a subagent. Full conversation context, zero tools, zero history pollution. Answers appear in a dismissible overlay. Reuses prompt cache so cost is near-zero. Works while the main agent is processing.

**Implementation:** Separate LLM call with same message history but `tools: []`. Response rendered in TUI overlay, not appended to session JSONL.

### Agent Teams with Worktree Isolation
Git worktrees give each agent a full copy of the repo. No merge conflicts during work. Clean merge at the end. This is the right primitive for parallel agents.

### Prompt Cache Preservation
System prompt is static and cached. Dynamic context arrives as system reminders injected into user messages, preserving the cache hit. This is ~90% cost savings on the system prompt for every turn.

### Haiku Sidecar
Use a cheap, fast model for:
- Bash command safety classification
- Conversation summarization (for compact + session resume)
- Loading message generation
- Context usage analysis

### Double-Escape Rewind
Checkpoint after each tool call. Double-escape lets you rewind to any checkpoint. Both conversation state and filesystem state (via git) are restored.

---

## Extension System

TypeScript modules with full system access. Loaded from:
- `~/.ap/extensions/` (global)
- `.ap/extensions/` (per-project)
- npm packages (`blush install <package>`)

**Extension API:**
```typescript
export default function activate(ap: ApContext) {
  // Register tools
  ap.tools.register({
    name: 'my-tool',
    description: '...',
    schema: Type.Object({ ... }),
    execute: async (params) => { ... }
  });

  // Register commands
  ap.commands.register('/my-cmd', async (args) => { ... });

  // Register event handlers
  ap.events.on('message:before', async (msg) => { ... });
  ap.events.on('tool:after', async (result) => { ... });

  // Inject dynamic context
  ap.context.append('Always consider accessibility...');
}
```

**Skills (progressive disclosure):**
Loaded on-demand when invoked. Zero context cost until activated. Stored as markdown with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: security-review
trigger: /security-review
tools: [read, grep, bash]
---

Analyze pending changes for security vulnerabilities...
```

## What AP Is NOT

- Not a hosted service or SaaS
- Not a VS Code extension (terminal-first)
- Not a wrapper around Claude Code (independent agent)
- Not opinionated about workflow (extensible primitives)
- Not locked to Anthropic (multi-provider from day 1)

---

## Prior Art & Attribution

- **pi.dev** (Mario Zechner) -- architecture inspiration, minimalism philosophy
- **Claude Code** (Anthropic) -- /btw, teams, compact, branch, context patterns
- **oh-my-pi** (can1357) -- hashline edits, LSP integration ideas
- **OpenClaw** -- multi-platform agent deployment pattern

- `blush sessions` -- list sessions for cwd
- `./packages/cli/dist/bin.js` -- runs directly (shebang + chmod)
- `/diff`, `/context`, `/skills`, `/theme` -- work without API key
- All 5 packages build clean in ~3s (full turbo cache in 7ms)
- Extension system loads from ~/.ap/extensions/ and .ap/extensions/
- Skills loaded from ~/.ap/skills/ and .ap/skills/
- Provider auto-detection: claude*, gpt-5* (Codex when available), gpt-4*/o1*/o3*
- Custom endpoint support: `ollama:model`, `local:model`, `http://url:port/v1:model`
- SDK: `import { createApSession } from '@blush/cli/sdk'`
- Core tools available to the agent: `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `glob`, `grep`, `todo`

**What needs API key to test end-to-end:**
- Full agent loop (send -> LLM -> tool calls -> loop)
- /btw ephemeral questions
- /compact conversation compression
- /team spawn + synthesize
- Skill activation (sends prompt to agent)
- Sidecar bash safety checks

9. `82a6297` -- Wren compression integration
   - Auto-detects ~/wren/bin/wren CLI or HTTP endpoint

   - Two modes: input (prompts) and output (tool results)
   - Silently skips when unavailable

10. `(current)` -- Complete feature set
    - `ap init`: interactive first-time setup (dirs, config, AGENTS.md)
    - `!command` bash passthrough (output added to conversation context)
    - `/copy [N]`: clipboard copy with code block detection (pbcopy/xclip)
    - Package registry: `blush install`, `ap list`, `ap remove` (npm, git, GitHub)
    - Prompt suggestions after responses via sidecar
    - Session resume uses proper config.session path (no mutation)
    - Updated help with all subcommands and key bindings
    - Comprehensive README with all features documented

### 2026-04-02 -- Identity, Team Patterns, Tests, CI/CD

**Changes:**

1. Fixed identity: replaced all Claude Code branding in OAuth layer with Blush/ap.haus identity
   - `OAUTH_IDENTITY` now says "Blush, a terminal coding agent from ap.haus"
   - Renamed `getClaudeCodeOAuth()` to `getSubscriptionOAuth()` (still reads Claude Code keychain)
   - Updated error messages and comments

2. Implemented review consensus pattern (`reviewPeer()`)
   - Reviewer agent gets target's output + git diff
   - Parses APPROVED/CHANGES_REQUESTED response
   - Sends feedback back to target if not approved
   - Wired to `/team review <target> <reviewer> [--criteria "..."]`

3. Implemented pipeline consensus pattern (`runPipeline()`)
   - Sequential handoff: each stage gets previous stage's output
   - Auto-spawns agents on-demand
   - Wired to `/team pipeline agent1:"task1" agent2:"task2" ...`

4. Added tests for all untested packages (56 total across 7 files)
   - `@blush/tui`: 15 tests (themes, input parsing, markdown rendering)
   - `@blush/cli`: 7 tests (command parsing, branding, exports)
   - `@blush/team`: 15 tests (mailbox, taskqueue, worktree)

5. Added GitHub Actions CI/CD
   - `ci.yml`: build + test on push/PR (Node 20 + 22 matrix)
   - `publish.yml`: publish to npm on version tags

6. Configured npm publish pipeline
   - All 5 packages: `publishConfig`, `repository`, `files`, `keywords`, `license`, `author`
   - `pnpm -r publish --access public` for scoped @blush/* packages

**Remaining work:**
- End-to-end testing with real API key
- Set `NPM_TOKEN` secret in GitHub repo for publish workflow
- First publish: `git tag v0.1.0 && git push --tags`
- Product polish pass on session UX, input composer, tool timeline, and team ergonomics

---

*Last updated: 2026-04-02*
*Status: Core architecture is in place, but product polish is still in progress. Shipping-quality session UX, trusted status surfaces, richer input, and deeper team workflows remain active work.*
